##Notes: 
Aim for no more than 1,000 words plus images. References not included in count. Reference in any style, but be consistent.
Documentation should be presented either on your main Github repository readme.md or linked from there.
There is no set format for this, however, we are keen to see a strong visual component as well as some contextual detail

##Prototype
**NOTE: To use this prototype you should resize your browser to be similar to that of a mobile phone screen or use a mobile phone. This will provide you with a more realistic experience as the prototype has only been designed for mobile devices.**

##Promotional Material
NACT will be promoted through the use of a kickstarter-style website. 



~~about the website~~

In order to attract users and build a larger community base, the application will also have a great social media presence. Utilising social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter will greatly increase our market reach and help target our targeted audience.


##Summary

News is often biased, false, misleading or has malicious intent. NACT aims to create a positive community which collaborates to remove bias, provide facts, limit opinions, opposes fear mongering.

We addressed this issue by prototyping a smartphone based application called Nact, that utilises crowd sourced data in the form of a collaborative community. Nact is a platform where this community can come together to modify and moderate news articles, fact check sources and submit evidence to support the truth rather than the story being pushed by the news outlet.

##The Process
~~{would like to add some theory stuff from lectures throughout}~~


The prototyping process took several steps, in a near agile development process. Throughout the semester the team would all participate in stand-ups which would help with collaboration and discuss what has been completed and what is needed to progress forward with the prototype. Zenhub along with Github were also used throughout the process in order to enhance task allocation and collaboration.


The process was primarily split up into three stand-ups which were treated as sprints. The first of these stand-ups allowed us to conduct research as well as basic wireframe mockups for the prototype. This research was used to understand the problem space, market and user base. Through analysing the existing markets and the users that form the communities within these applications, we were able to understand where NACT could emerge and make an impact on the already existing market. The second stand-up allowed for further progression with the mock-ups into functioning Invision prototypes. User testing was also conducted to receive feedback that was used to guide changes to the functionality, user interface and user experience. Advertising and promotional material was also a focus throughout this sprint. Advertising was aimed towards a specific audience based on user research which created our target market. Idea generation for the promotional material also took place. The third and final stand-up was treated as the last sprint before the final deadline. Feedback and changes played a major role in this stand-up. A google form was used to retrieve feedback from users that we could use to improve the functionality and design of the website.


##Workload Distribution

The workload was distributed evenly with members of the team taking on tasks each week and working towards each sprint. Main roles for each group member are as follows;

Matthew Lord -- Mockups/Application

Scott Gillam -- Website

Sah Kilic -- Testing/Documentation

Cameron McGavin -- Research/Documentation



A further breakdown of the tasks that each member contributed time to each week can be found below.
