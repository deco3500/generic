##Feedback & Changes
After modifying and adding changes from the last survey/user tests, the prototype had significantly improved to accommodate the needs and wants of the target users. It was clear through additional user testing that a number of previously identified issues were resolved. These included

- The addition of a comments section
- Local news options
- Proof submission

The additional user testing on this updated prototype revealed that some of these fixes and additions, as well as other previously non considered issues were present. The user testing was not carried out through a survey but rather an interview/Q&A style session. The testing was conducted in this manner so we could observe how the user was operating the application as well as their struggles during this process. Some obvious problems were uncovered, such as a lack of easy navigation for certain functions i.e. a cancel button for submitting proof. On addition to this, some other more difficult to observe problems were also uncovered. Users were struggling to use the application in an intuitive manner. Users were trying to scroll, exit and fluidly try to use the application when the functionality wasn't there. This seemed to be a problem with not having implemented the application with more consideration to common smartphone interaction methods.

The users found that the features included were up to standard. The focus for the new prototype was to produce something that incorporated those features in a much more naturally usable manner. We shifted from the InVision prototoype to a functional web based, mobile friendly prototype. This was made in an effort to have more control over each feature and the application in its entirety.
