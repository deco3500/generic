##Feedback
Before requesting formal feedback from potential users, we sought out some general feedback by showing the mockups and explain what the idea entailed. Some feedback included users saying that the name psCmm is confusing. Since then the name has been changed to Nact. Nact simply means News Fact.

Other informal feedback included some suggestions for possible features or other methods of implementing our idea. This became difficult to keep track of, hence we compiled our target demographic information from prior research and found users to test a prototype and provide feedback through a survey. This was ages 18 to 29 that used the mobile Reddit application.

The feedback received was generally constructive. Most users thought the UI was easy to understand and operate. However, there was some issues present. Not all users understood the purpose of the application. This issue can be solved in practice by either a description on the relevant store front, at the point of download but could also be solved by an initial boot information page in the app. We’ve decided to let this go for now as we’re focused on more of the usability side of the application.

Other suggestions included a comment section which was already in the backlog and a flagging system to label articles (clickbait etc.) which was also in the backlog. One user also suggested that a flair system might be appropriate as part of gamification by rewarding users who contribute significantly. There were also a few issues with users not willing to use the application as they felt that it may be an unreliable source of news as it is editable by almost anyone.  

Most of these issues were addressed in the new iteration of the mockups that extends on the previous iteration. There was an addition of a comment section, a flagging function as well as the first steps of making content more reliable by providing the option to upload evidence. There will be more features that will improve upon this in the future, however the mockups below are the progress so far.


##Mockups
Due to requests to see more features of the application, new mock-ups have been created. Based on the feedback received from Sah, I added in some new features and visiblity from the main menu. I researched common ways to display this information such as default iOS and Android windows. I looked at existing designs from other popular applications and drew inspiration from these.

These are the new designs which have been implemented:

##Promotional Material

###Website

Throughout the last few weeks we decided to begin our promotional website early so that we dont have to rush it later on. To begin with the website a fair amount of research was done. This research was undertaken by browsing kickstarter and viewing the promotional websites for each successful product. The research was fairly straight forward as a lot of the websites were very similar, there is a certain style of page at the moment and I believe that this is a great way to begin with our website. So far there are a few mockups that have been drawn up for the website. At the moment the physical webstie is extremely basic and just a few divs that have beenset up. When planning this website it was decided to first get all the content containers set up and functional before starting to add the content. This will help a lot with workflow rather than trying to do it all at once.

###Advertising

Marketing will be a big part of NACT. Retaining users is one thing however first we need to gather users to get the application off the ground. Promotional material will consist mainly of our promo website which will advertise the application giving all key features that may entice users to use Nact.

Advertising methods have a few main things considered in order to target a specific audience. The main factors that are considered in advertising is the demographic, location, message and frequency. Our target age demographic was 18-50 and will be the main factor used to target our advertising.

In considering the demographic, it is known that our users will consist of people who often view news/media/information online. Therefore online advertising is a solid choice. Given the age demographic, social media usage will be high therefore not only social media advertising will be utilised but Nact must have a presence on various forms of social media such as creating a Facebook page/profile.

Location will be global as the application does have global potential therefore specific city/suburb advertisement methods such as billboards and radio advertisements will not be the most effective method.

##InVision Prototype
The mockups displayed above have been integrated to work as a basic prototype through InVision. This prototype has been used for testing  and demonstration purposes and will continue to be updated as new iterations of mockups are created. As this is a gradual process, not all features are implemented and not all features are intended to work as represented here.
