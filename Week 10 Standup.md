##Feedback
Before requesting formal feedback from potential users, we sought out some general feedback by showing the mockups and explain what the idea entailed. Some feedback included users saying that the name psCmm is confusing. Since then the name has been changed to Nact. Nact simply means News Fact.

Other informal feedback included some suggestions for possible features or other methods of implementing our idea. This became difficult to keep track of, hence we compiled our target demographic information from prior research and found users to test a prototype and provide feedback through a survey. This was ages 18 to 29 that used the mobile Reddit application.

The feedback received was generally constructive. Most users thought the UI was easy to understand and operate. However, there was some issues present. Not all users understood the purpose of the application. This issue can be solved in practice by either a description on the relevant store front, at the point of download but could also be solved by an initial boot information page in the app. We’ve decided to let this go for now as we’re focused on more of the usability side of the application.

Other suggestions included a comment section which was already in the backlog and a flagging system to label articles (clickbait etc.) which was also in the backlog. One user also suggested that a flair system might be appropriate as part of gamification by rewarding users who contribute significantly. There were also a few issues with users not willing to use the application as they felt that it may be an unreliable source of news as it is editable by almost anyone.  

Most of these issues were addressed in the new iteration of the mockups that extends on the previous iteration. There was an addition of a comment section, a flagging function as well as the first steps of making content more reliable by providing the option to upload evidence. There will be more features that will improve upon this in the future, however the mockups below are the progress so far.


##Mockups
Due to requests to see more features of the application, new mock-ups have been created.
